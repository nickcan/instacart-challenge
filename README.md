# Instacart Shopper challenge

#### Part I: Frontend
Unfortonately, I decided to tackle this section second and ran into an issue setting up a Rails 5 app with a React client.
Therefore, this is not complete and simply uses a CRA to at least get something down. Just didn't have the time after the error.

To run the app:

cd ./shopper_challenge
yarn start or npm start


#### Part II: Backend
From root directory, run script with:
ruby applicant_monitor.rb "2014-08-01" "2014-09-01"
